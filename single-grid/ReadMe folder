hello guy!!!
this is a test of one of my very  first projects comprising of Html and CSS
its basically a card system 
I used flexbox to create a responsive layout for the design in order for it to change to different sizes when switching layouts 
hope you have a fun time going around this website 
enjoy yourself and would love to hear feedbacks on what I should have done better 
thanks and have a nice day
